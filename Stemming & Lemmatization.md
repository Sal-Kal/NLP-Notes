#Pre-Processing 
- These are techniques used to normalize texts like reading to read, books to book etc.
- Stemming may result in word which may not actually exist, but lemming makes sure the word generated by it is present in the English Dictionary.
- We use the following code snippet to download the necessary libraries for Stemming and Lemmatization
```python
nltk.download("punkt")
nltk.download("stopwords")
nltk.download("wordnet")
```
In case of ssl error run the following:
```python
import nltk
import ssl

try:
    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
except AttributeError:
    pass
else:
    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context

nltk.download("punkt")
nltk.download("stopwords")
nltk.download("wordnet")
```
## Stemming:
```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()

phrase = "reading the books"
words = word_tokenize(phrase)

stemmed_words = []
for word in words:
    stemmed_words.append(stemmer.stem(word))

print(stemmed_words)
```
Output:
```
['read', 'the', 'book']
```
- We first tokenize the sentence and them stem each token as shown in the example above.
- Stemming a word like _stories_ might result in _stori_. Which is not a word in the English dicitonary.
- The tokenizer used above also tokenizes periods.
## Lemmatization:
```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

phrase = "reading the books"
words = word_tokenize(phrase)

lemmatized_words = []
for word in words:
    lemmatized_words.append(lemmatizer.lemmatize(word))

print(lemmatized_words)
```
Output:
```
['reading', 'the', 'book']
```
- We see that the `lemmatizer` didn't lematize _reading_ to _read_ because it assumes all the words are nouns. This can be fixed by using the `pos` parameter while using the `lematize()` function.
```python
lemmatized_words.append(lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos='v'))
```
- Now it assumes all words are verbs and produces the following output.
```
['read', 'the', 'book']
```
- Here it assumes _books_ to be a verb as in _Did you book the tickets?_.
